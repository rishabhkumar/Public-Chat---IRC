# Public-Chat---IRC
A noob attempt on making an IRC! Technology Used : Java (J2SE)



It is a Multi-Threaded Public Chat in which the Server stays in anb infinite loop to accept as many Client requests as possible and create an environment for them to chat with one another!

## Note :- When running the programs on your workstation, please change the IP Address in the code accordingly
and also see the correctness of the Portnumber for each Server-Client pair!
